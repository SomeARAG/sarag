SARAG 1.0

(Some bug fixes)

(1) gcdFreePart should be now correct

(2) sRem and sSubRes compute sequences that
are now longer by one element

---------------------------------------------------
SARAG beta 0.4

(1) newtonFromPoly(pol,var,len) now takes three arguments:
it computes a sequence of Newton sums of length "len"

(2) code clean up ("subRes"-> "sSubRes", "sSubResSignChanges"-> "genPermMVar")


---------------------------------------------------
SARAG beta 0.3

(1) bug fixes
- drawTopology: 
it now computes
the correct topology of points
at infinity

(2) new functions
- echelonMod : 
it computes
the Echelon form of a matrix

(3) test files:
- "arag_test.mac"
It tests the examples contained
in the book "Algorithms in Real
Algebraic Geometry" (which contains
SARAG and uses Maxima in its electronic version)
- "hard_test.mac"
It tests some other commands involve
more computation  (mostly topology computations)

(4) updated "readme.txt"
